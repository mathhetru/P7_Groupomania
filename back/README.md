This is the back end server for Project 7 of the Web Developer path.

### Back end Prerequisites ###
You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

Please create .env in the "back" folder with your account name in `account="xxx"`, your password in `mdp="xxx"` and your name database in `database="xxx"`. Check "app.js" if you need more informations. 

### Back end Installation ###
Clone this repo. 
From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`. You can then run the server with `node server` or `nodemon server`. 
Then "install dependencies" from package.json
If you have any trouble, don't hesitate to check and update every package with `npm install -g npm-check-updates`.
The back server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the server runs on another port for any reason, 
this is printed to the console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
